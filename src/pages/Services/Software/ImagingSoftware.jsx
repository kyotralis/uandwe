const IMAGING_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is Beamforming in Ultrasound?",
        answer: "An ultrasound probe has hundreds of tiny piezoelectric crystals. Beamforming is the complex mathematical process of firing them at slightly different times (nanoseconds apart) to steer and focus the sound wave electronically, then interpreting the echoes to form an image."
    },
    {
        question: "Why use GPUs for medical imaging instead of main processors?",
        answer: "Image reconstruction requires performing the exact same mathematical operation (like an FFT) millions of times simultaneously. A standard CPU has 8 cores; a GPU has thousands. GPUs can process images in real-time that would take a CPU minutes."
    },
    {
        question: "What is DICOM?",
        answer: "Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. It is the universal standard format for storing and transmitting medical images. It ensures an MRI taken on a Siemens machine can be viewed by a doctor on a GE workstation."
    },
    {
        question: "How does FDA regulate AI in imaging?",
        answer: "Very strictly. If your AI tells a doctor 'This is a tumor', it is a Class III medical device. We help clients design 'locked' algorithms (they don't change after deployment) and run the clinical trials to prove they are as accurate as a radiologist."
