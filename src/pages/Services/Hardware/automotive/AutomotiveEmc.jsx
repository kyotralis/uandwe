const EMC_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is the difference between Emissions and Immunity?",
        answer: "Emissions testing ensures your device doesn't broadcast noise that ruins other electronics (like the radio). Immunity testing blasts your device with noise to ensure it doesn't crash."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do automotive EMC standards seem so much harder than consumer electronics?",
        answer: "If your laptop crashes due to static shock, it's annoying. If an airbag controller crashes on the highway due to interference from a cell tower, it's deadly. The immunity requirements are orders of magnitude higher."
    },
    {
        question: "Can we just wrap the PCB in a metal box?",
        answer: "Shielding is heavy, expensive, and often ineffective if wires act as antennas passing through the shield. It's always cheaper and lighter to eliminate the noise at the source (the PCB layout) than to block it later."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Load Dump?",
        answer: "If the car battery is disconnected while the alternator is spinning (e.g., a loose cable over a bump), the alternator dumps massive energy into the 12V bus, causing a spike up to 100V. ECUs must survive this without damage."
