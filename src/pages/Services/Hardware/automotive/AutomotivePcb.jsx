const PCB_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is HDI (High Density Interconnect)?",
        answer: "As chips like the Snapdragon get smaller but have more pins, you can't use standard through-hole vias. HDI uses microscopic lasers to drill 'micro-vias' that only go down one layer, saving massive amounts of space."
    },
    {
        question: "What are creepage and clearance?",
        answer: "In EV inverters (800V), high voltage can arc across the board or through the air. Clearance is the shortest distance through the air between two conductors. Creepage is the shortest distance along the surface of the PCB. We must rigorously enforce these gaps."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do automotive boards need different materials?",
        answer: "A standard FR4 board from a laptop will literally turn black and delaminate if put under the hood of a car. We specify high-Tg (glass transition temperature) laminates that can withstand continuous 125°C+ heat."
    },
    {
        question: "What is heavy copper?",
        answer: "A standard PCB uses 1oz copper (about 1.4 thousandths of an inch thick). EV power electronics require massive currents that would melt standard traces. We design boards using up to 10oz copper to carry hundreds of amps."
