const SECURITY_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is a Hardware Security Module (HSM)?",
        answer: "It's essentially a tiny, highly secure computer inside the main automotive computer. It has its own processor and memory. Even if a hacker compromises the main processor, they cannot access the keys stored inside the HSM."
    },
    {
        question: "What is UNECE R155?",
        answer: "It is a new, binding regulation. Starting in 2024, if a vehicle manufacturer cannot prove they have a certified Cyber Security Management System (CSMS), they cannot legally sell cars in Europe, Japan, or Korea."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you protect against physical attacks?",
        answer: "If someone physically steals an ECU, they might try to 'glitch' the power supply to bypass a password check, or read the electromagnetic emissions (Side-Channel Analysis) to steal a key. We design the PCB layout and power filters to block these attacks."
    },
    {
        question: "What is SecOC?",
        answer: "Secure Onboard Communication. In the past, any ECU could send a 'BRAKE!' command on the CAN bus. SecOC attaches a cryptographic signature to the message, proving it came from the actual brake pedal and isn't a hacker's replay."
