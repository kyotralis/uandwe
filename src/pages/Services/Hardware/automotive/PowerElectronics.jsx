const POWER_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why switch to Silicon Carbide (SiC)?",
        answer: "Traditional IGBTs switch relatively slowly, creating heat (switching losses). SiC MOSFETs switch extremely fast, radically reducing heat. This means you can use a smaller cooling system, increasing the vehicle's range."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an On-Board Charger (OBC)?",
        answer: "The battery stores DC power, but the grid provides AC power. The OBC is the heavy piece of hardware inside the car that converts AC from your house into DC to charge the battery. (Note: DC Fast Chargers bypass the OBC entirely)."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is 800V becoming the standard?",
        answer: "Power = Voltage × Current. To charge a car faster, you need more power. If you increase current, cables get massive and heavy. If you increase voltage to 800V, you can push twice the power through the same thin, lightweight cable."
    },
    {
        question: "What makes Gate Drivers so critical in SiC designs?",
        answer: "Because SiC switches so incredibly fast, a slight timing error or parasitic inductance can cause the switch to turn on when it shouldn't, causing a catastrophic short circuit. Gate drivers must be perfectly isolated and extremely precise."
