const IMPLANTABLE_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is Single Fault Tolerance?",
        answer: "A regulatory requirement for Class III devices. It means that if any single component on the board fails (like a resistor shorting out), the device must either continue to work perfectly, or fail safely without harming the patient."
    },
    {
        question: "Why use the MICS band instead of Bluetooth?",
        answer: "The Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) operates around 400 MHz, which penetrates human tissue much better than the 2.4 GHz used by Bluetooth. However, Bluetooth is increasingly being used for implants that don't sit too deep."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you achieve a 10-year battery life?",
        answer: "By designing circuits where the 'off' state draws only pico-amps of current. We use specialized, extremely low-leakage capacitors and program the processor to sleep 99.9% of the time, waking only for a few microseconds to measure a heartbeat."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a 'feedthrough'?",
        answer: "The electronics are sealed in a welded titanium can. But you still need wires to exit the can to connect to the heart or brain. A feedthrough is a complex ceramic-to-metal seal that allows a wire to pass through the titanium wall while maintaining a perfect vacuum inside."
