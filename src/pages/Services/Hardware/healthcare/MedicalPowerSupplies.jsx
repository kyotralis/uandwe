const POWER_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is MOPP vs. MOOP?",
        answer: "MOPP stands for Means of Patient Protection. MOOP is Means of Operator Protection. If a device touches a patient (like an ultrasound wand), its power supply requires 2x MOPP—meaning it has double the insulation and physical spacing of a normal power supply to prevent electric shock."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a CF, BF, or B rating?",
        answer: "These are 'Applied Part' ratings. CF (Cardiac Floating) means the device directly touches the heart (e.g., a pacemaker lead). It requires the strictest limits on leakage current (less than 10 microamps). BF is for body contact (ECG), and B is for non-conductive contact (hospital bed)."
    },
    {
        question: "Why do we need custom magnetics?",
        answer: "The transformer is the physical barrier between the 120V wall outlet and the patient. Off-the-shelf transformers are often too bulky or don't meet the strict 8mm+ creepage distances required by IEC 60601-1. We design custom transformers to fit the exact mechanical envelope while guaranteeing safety."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Defibrillator Protection?",
        answer: "If a patient is hooked up to an ECG monitor and goes into cardiac arrest, a doctor will shock them with 4,000 volts. If the ECG isn't designed correctly, that 4kV pulse will travel up the wires, blow up the ECG machine, and potentially shock the doctor. We design the hardware to block this pulse."
