const WEARABLE_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is a Rigid-Flex PCB?",
        answer: "Instead of connecting two stiff circuit boards with a bulky wire connector, a rigid-flex board has a flexible ribbon of polyimide integrated directly into the board layers, allowing it to fold up origami-style inside a tiny enclosure."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is analog design so important for wearables?",
        answer: "The body doesn't output 1s and 0s. It outputs tiny chemical or electrical changes. If your analog circuit adds noise, your software algorithm will fail, no matter how good your AI is. The hardware must capture a pristine signal."
    },
    {
        question: "What does '01005' mean?",
        answer: "It refers to the physical size of a component (like a resistor). A 01005 resistor is roughly the size of a grain of pepper. Using these allows us to shrink the PCB to fit inside a ring or patch."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you test a wearable before making expensive molds?",
        answer: "We use high-resolution SLA 3D printers and CNC machining to create form-factor-accurate prototypes. This allows us to test the ergonomics and antenna performance before cutting $50,000 steel injection molds."
