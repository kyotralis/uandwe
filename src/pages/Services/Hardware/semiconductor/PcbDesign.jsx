const PCB_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Can you handle high-layer count, complex server boards?",
        answer: "Yes. We frequently design 24+ layer backplanes and compute modules utilizing Megtron 6 or Rogers materials, accommodating massive BGA processors and thousands of high-speed nets."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide mechanical 3D integration models?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We export accurate STEP/IDF files directly from the ECAD layout, allowing your mechanical engineering team to verify enclosure fit, thermal clearances, and connector alignments in SolidWorks or Fusion360."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure the board doesn't overheat?",
        answer: "We perform thermal co-simulation. By analyzing the power dissipation of key ICs against the copper weight and thermal via placement, we ensure the board stays within safe operating temperatures."
    },
    {
        question: "What deliverables do you provide at the end of the project?",
        answer: "We provide a complete manufacturing package: Gerber/ODB++ files, drill files, Pick and Place data, comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM), fabrication drawings, and the native CAD source files."
