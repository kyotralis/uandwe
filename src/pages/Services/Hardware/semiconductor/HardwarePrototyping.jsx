const PROTOTYPE_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "How fast can you deliver a functional prototype?",
        answer: "Depending on component availability and PCB layer count, we can often execute a 'quick-turn' cycle—going from finalized schematic to a powered-on board in as little as 2 to 3 weeks."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle the mechanical enclosure design?",
        answer: "Yes. Our mechanical engineers work concurrently with our electrical team. We design the enclosure, print it in-house, and ensure the PCBA fits perfectly before any metal tooling is cut."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if the first prototype has a hardware bug?",
        answer: "That's exactly what prototypes are for. Our lab technicians are experts at microsoldering. We will cut traces, add jumper wires, and modify components on the fly to get the board working and validate the fix for the next revision."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you build 50 units for our beta testers?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We manage NPI (New Product Introduction) pilot runs, sourcing components, managing the CM (Contract Manufacturer), and functionally testing all 50 units before delivering them to you."
