const VALIDATION_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why do we need EVT, DVT, and PVT phases?",
        answer: "This methodology controls risk. EVT ensures the core electronics work. DVT ensures the integrated product survives the real world. PVT ensures the factory can build it reliably at scale. Skipping a phase almost always results in expensive recalls."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide official CE/FCC certification?",
        answer: "We perform Pre-Compliance. We run the exact same tests in our labs to ensure the device will pass. We then manage the relationship and logistics with an accredited NRTL (Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory) to secure the official stamps."
    },
    {
        question: "What is HALT testing?",
        answer: "Highly Accelerated Life Testing. We subject the device to extreme, simultaneous temperature changes and six-axis vibration until it physically breaks. This allows us to find the design's ultimate limits and improve its real-world lifespan."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you test boards on the assembly line?",
        answer: "We design 'Bed-of-Nails' fixtures. The operator places the board on a custom jig, pulls down a lever to engage pogo-pins, and a Python script automatically flashes the firmware, pings the sensors, and outputs a Pass/Fail in seconds."
