const VALIDATION_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is the difference between FCC Part 15 and PTCRB?",
        answer: "FCC Part 15 ensures your device doesn't emit unintended noise that interferes with others. PTCRB is a cellular carrier requirement ensuring your device plays nice with their specific cellular network."
    },
    {
        question: "Why did my device fail radiated emissions?",
        answer: "The most common causes are poor grounding, cables acting as antennas, or high-speed clocks lacking spread-spectrum modulation. We use near-field probes to pinpoint the exact source."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does carrier certification take?",
        answer: "Typically 4 to 8 weeks, assuming the hardware passes on the first attempt. Our pre-compliance testing is designed to ensure you pass on that critical first attempt."
    },
    {
        question: "What does NEBS Level 3 entail?",
        answer: "NEBS Level 3 is required for equipment placed in a telecom central office. It includes intense testing for fire resistance, earthquake survival, spatial requirements, and extreme acoustics."
