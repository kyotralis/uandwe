const ANTENNA_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why did my off-the-shelf antenna stop working when I put it in the enclosure?",
        answer: "This is called dielectric detuning. The plastic enclosure acts like a lens, shifting the resonant frequency of the antenna. We fix this by simulating the enclosure and pre-shifting the antenna's tuning to compensate."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Phased Array antenna?",
        answer: "Instead of physically moving a satellite dish, a phased array uses dozens of small antennas. By minutely delaying the signal to each one, the combined beam can be steered electronically in microseconds."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you design a single antenna for multiple cellular bands?",
        answer: "Yes. We design complex fractal, IFA, and monopole structures with active tuning circuits that can cover everything from 700MHz LTE to Sub-6GHz 5G."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide radiation pattern plots?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You will receive comprehensive 3D plots showing directivity, gain, efficiency, and cross-polarization isolation from both simulation and physical chamber testing."
