const BSP_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What do you need from us to start BSP development?",
        answer: "Ideally, we need the preliminary schematics (PDF or EDA format), the pin-mux configuration file, the target OS requirements, and the datasheet for any highly specialized proprietary ICs on the board."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you handle bugs that might be hardware issues?",
        answer: "We use JTAG debuggers, logic analyzers, and oscilloscopes to isolate the issue. If we suspect a hardware bug (e.g., a missing pull-up resistor or timing violation), we provide your hardware team with precise electrical captures proving the issue."
    },
    {
        question: "Can you create a custom Yocto layer for our board?",
        answer: "Yes, a core part of our BSP delivery is providing a clean, self-contained Yocto `meta-<your-company>` layer that seamlessly builds the bootloader, kernel, and rootfs for your specific board."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you write manufacturing test code?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We write minimal, fast-booting firmware designed specifically for the factory floor to ping I2C devices, test RAM, and verify networking PHYs before the board is shipped."
