    },
    {
        question: "What are Software Safety Classes (A, B, C)?",
        answer: "IEC 62304 classifies software by risk. Class A means no injury is possible. Class B means non-serious injury is possible. Class C means death or serious injury is possible. Class C requires the most exhaustive testing and documentation."
    },
    {
        question: "What is SOUP?",
        answer: "Software of Unknown Provenance. It refers to off-the-shelf software (like Linux, FreeRTOS, or a math library) that you didn't write. IEC 62304 has strict rules on how to evaluate and safely use SOUP in a medical device."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide the documentation for our FDA submission?",
        answer: "Yes. The code is only half the deliverable. We provide the complete set of software artifacts (SRS, Architecture, Unit Tests, Traceability Matrix) ready to be dropped into your 510(k) or PMA submission."
