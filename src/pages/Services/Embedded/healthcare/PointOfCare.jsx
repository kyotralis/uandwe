const POC_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why use Embedded Linux for a medical device?",
        answer: "As devices require rich touchscreens, Wi-Fi, and complex networking (HL7), a simple RTOS is no longer enough. Linux provides all these features for free, but requires expertise to make it secure and reliable enough for FDA approval."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Hypervisor?",
        answer: "If you have a robotic surgery console, you can't let a crash in the touchscreen UI stop the robot arm. A hypervisor is a piece of software that splits the processor in half: one half runs Linux (UI), the other half runs a safe RTOS (Robot). If Linux crashes, the RTOS keeps running."
    },
    {
        question: "What is IEC 62366?",
        answer: "It is the standard for Usability Engineering. The FDA requires proof that a stressed, tired nurse at 3 AM will not misread a dosage on your screen or press the wrong button due to poor UI design."
    },
    {
        question: "Why use Qt instead of Android?",
        answer: "While Android is great for phones, it is massive and changes constantly. Qt allows us to build highly customized, fluid UIs on top of a very stripped-down, stable Linux kernel, which is much easier to certify for a medical device."
