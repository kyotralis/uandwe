const ALGORITHM_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why is motion artifact so hard to remove from PPG?",
        answer: "When a person jogs, the blood sloshing in their wrist creates a signal at the exact same frequency as their heartbeat. Without advanced IMU cancellation, the sensor will lock onto the cadence of the footsteps, not the heart."
    },
    {
        question: "What is TinyML?",
        answer: "Machine learning traditionally runs on massive cloud servers. TinyML is the process of compressing neural networks so small they can run on a $2 microcontroller using only kilobytes of RAM."
    },
    {
        question: "Why not send all the raw data to the cloud?",
        answer: "Power. Turning on the Bluetooth radio to transmit raw 500Hz ECG data takes massive amounts of battery. It is much more battery-efficient to analyze the data locally and only transmit the final result (e.g., 'Heart Rate: 72')."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you handle skin tone bias in optical sensors?",
        answer: "Melanin absorbs green light, which is traditionally used for PPG. We develop multi-wavelength algorithms (using green, red, and infrared LEDs) and train our models on highly diverse datasets to ensure equal accuracy for all patients."
