const CONNECTED_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "Why is connecting a medical device different than connecting a smartwatch?",
        answer: "If a smartwatch drops a Bluetooth connection, a text message is delayed. If a continuous glucose monitor drops a connection, a patient might miss a critical hypoglycemia alert. Medical connectivity requires strict state machines and guaranteed reconnection logic."
    },
    {
        question: "Can we use standard Wi-Fi in a hospital?",
        answer: "Yes, but hospital IT networks use WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise (EAP-TLS), which requires the device to hold a cryptographic certificate to join the network. Consumer devices (like smart plugs) usually don't support this."
    },
    {
        question: "What is an OTA update, and why is it risky?",
        answer: "Over-The-Air updates allow you to change the firmware remotely. It's risky because if the battery dies halfway through writing to flash memory, the device is 'bricked'. We use dual-bank memory architectures to prevent this."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Coexistence testing?",
        answer: "Hospitals have hundreds of Wi-Fi routers, BLE beacons, and microwave ovens all screaming on the 2.4GHz band. FDA requires proof that your device's radio won't be jammed by this noise, nor will it jam other critical devices."
